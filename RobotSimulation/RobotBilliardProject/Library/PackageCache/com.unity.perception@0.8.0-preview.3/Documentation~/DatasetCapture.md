# DatasetCapture

`DatasetCapture` tracks egos, sensors, annotations, and metrics, combining them into a unified [JSON-based dataset](Schema/Synthetic_Dataset_Schema.md) on disk. It also controls the simulation time elapsed per frame to accommodate the active sensors.


## Sensor scheduling
While sensors are registered, `DatasetCapture` ensures that frame timing is deterministic and run at the appropriate simulation times to let each sensor render and capture at its own rate.

Using [Time.captureDeltaTime](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Time-captureDeltaTime.html), it also decouples wall clock time from simulation time, allowing the simulation to run as fast as possible.

## Custom sensors
You can register custom sensors using `DatasetCapture.RegisterSensor()`. The `simulationDeltaTime` you pass in at registration time is used as `Time.captureDeltaTime` and determines how often (in simulation time) frames should be simulated for the sensor to run. This and the `framesBetweenCaptures` value determine at which exact times the sensor should capture the simulated frames. The decoupling of simulation delta time and capture frequency based on frames simulated allows you to render frames in-between captures. If no in-between frames are desired, you can set `framesBetweenCaptures` to 0. When it is time to capture, the `ShouldCaptureThisFrame` check of the `SensorHandle` returns true. `SensorHandle.ReportCapture` should then be called in each of these frames to report the state of the sensor to populate the dataset.

`Time.captureDeltaTime` is set at every frame in order to precisely fall on the next sensor that requires simulation, and this includes multi-sensor simulations. For instance, if one sensor has a `simulationDeltaTime` of 2 and another 3, the first five values for `Time.captureDeltaTime` will be 2, 1, 1, 2, and 3, meaning simulation will happen on the timestamps 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9.

## Custom annotations and metrics
In addition to the common annotations and metrics produced by [PerceptionCamera](PerceptionCamera.md), scripts can produce their own via `DatasetCapture`. You must first register annotation and metric definitions using `DatasetCapture.RegisterAnnotationDefinition()` or `DatasetCapture.RegisterMetricDefinition()`. These return `AnnotationDefinition` and `MetricDefinition` instances which you can then use to report values during runtime.

Annotations and metrics are always associated with the frame they are reported in. They may also be associated with a specific sensor by using the `Report*` methods on `SensorHandle`.

```csharp

    SensorHandle cameraSensorHandle;

    public void Start()
    {
        //Metrics and annotations are registered up-front
        lightMetricDefinition = DatasetCapture.RegisterMetricDefinition(
            "Light position",
            "The world-space position of the light",
            Guid.Parse("1F6BFF46-F884-4CC5-A878-DB987278FE35"));
        boundingBoxAnnotationDefinition = DatasetCapture.RegisterAnnotationDefinition(
            "Target bounding box",
            "The position of the target in the camera's local space",
            id: Guid.Parse("C0B4A22C-0420-4D9F-BAFC-954B8F7B35A7"));
    }

    public void Update()
    {
        //Report the light's position by manually creating the json array string.
        var lightPos = targetLight.transform.position;
        DatasetCapture.ReportMetric(lightMetricDefinition,
            $@"[{{ ""x"": {lightPos.x}, ""y"": {lightPos.y}, ""z"": {lightPos.z} }}]");
        //compute the location of the object in the camera's local space
        Vector3 targetPos = transform.worldToLocalMatrix * target.transform.position;
        //Report using the PerceptionCamera's SensorHandle if scheduled this frame
        var sensorHandle = GetComponent<PerceptionCamera>().SensorHandle;
        if (sensorHandle.ShouldCaptureThisFrame)
        {
            sensorHandle.ReportAnnotationValues(
                boundingBoxAnnotationDefinition,
                new[] { targetPos });
        }
    }
